In the cadmium capture experiment we ensured the file size of the captured video HTTP requests differ depending on the conditions set by our javascript modifications.
The experiment was not successful as it provided unexpected results concerning the measured file size.

We have removed all content which is not necessary to understand the code. Feel free to go back to the commit @d35598 at 15.04.2018 12:40 if you miss something.
